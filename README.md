# College Recruitment Improvement Study
 Data Science Programming Assignment
The CCM Department of Information Technologies seeks to improve its recruitment process and increase the number of individuals in its computing classes and majors. A survey is administered every Fall semester for entry-level computing and computer literacy courses (for non-majors). I have been tasked to perform exploratory data analysis on the provided survey dataset. My analysis will inform the department about which/when/where/why students are taking their classes (as indicated in the survey dataset) so that they can focus their recruiting efforts on prosperous areas, particularly for under-represented groups.

Questions to answer:

1. Looking at the latest survey results (2023) from both the Majors and Non-Majors surveys, what are the gender demographic differences between the Majors and Non-Majors respondents?
2. Look at the records of just the Computing Majors only as one group (2021-2023). Computing Majors include: Computer Science, IT, Game Dev, Digital Media Technology, Technical Studies, Information Security, Data Analytics and Web Development.  What are the major motivations why computing majors seek a computing degree/certificate?
3. Looking at the latest survey results (2023) Which age group is most interested in pursuing a computing degree or certificate so you can target people in that age range more?
4. Looking at the latest survey results (2023) What sources were most popular in the "How did you hear about the County College of Morris" question to find which method is most efficient in outreach of students.
