# College Recruitment Improvement Study
 Data Science Programming Assignment
The CCM Department of Information Technologies seeks to improve its recruitment process and increase the number of individuals in its computing classes and majors. A survey is administered every Fall semester for entry-level computing and computer literacy courses (for non-majors). I have been tasked to perform exploratory data analysis on the provided survey dataset. My analysis will inform the department about which/when/where/why students are taking their classes (as indicated in the survey dataset) so that they can focus their recruiting efforts on prosperous areas, particularly for under-represented groups.
